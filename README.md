## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### Running tests

I decided to go with cypress and e2e testing since I am using native elements in the form and I don't see the point of unit testing these native elements.

From the terminal start the project using the `yarn start` command.

In a **NEW** terminal run the command `yarn cypress` to run integration tests.
